# Machine Learning Portfolio Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio! This repository showcases various projects using **supervised learning** such as **regression, classification with natural language processing (NLP)**, **unsupervised learning** such as **clustering** and built using real-world datasets. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook with clean, reproducible code and explanations.

### Regression
- **Concrete compressive Strength Prediction**  
  **Regression.ipynb** contains prediction of compressive strength of concrete using multiple regression models (Polynomial regression, ElasticNet, Random forest regression, Boosted trees like gradient boosting regressor and adaboost regressor). Compressive strength is the property of a material to withstand loads without deformation. This project includes GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

### Classification
- **Email Spam Detection (NLP)**  
  **Classification.ipynb** notebook consists of classification of emails as spam or not using NLP techniques like TF-IDF and models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. The notebook also explains about handling the imbalanced classes in the dataset.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
  **Clustering.ipynb** notebook consists of segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior using KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.  
  This project includes silhouette analysis for tuning hyperparameters in case of KMeans and Hierarchial clustering.
